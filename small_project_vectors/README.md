### TITLE: 
Enigma – Abstract Rainbow

### DESCRIPTION:

For the Generative Vector Abstraction Project, I decided to recreate an artwork by [Xolo Artist](https://www.saatchiart.com/xolox) displayed on the Saatchi Art website. While searching on the net about the artist, I did not manage to discover much about his works; Instead, I found another artist who has the same stage name, [Xolo Cantillo](https://www.saatchiart.com/xolocantillo) and creates similar artworks but using wood pieces. That's why I titled the artwork "Enigma – Abstract Rainbow".

### ARTWORK STRUCTURE:
1) **Background**: 
in the background, a sequence of specific shapes is displayed. By using 1 - 4 keys user will be able to change the shape currently displayed (1 – Triangles; 2 – Circles; 3 – Arcs; 4 – Squares).
2) Eyeball: 
the eyeball is displayed in one of the four corners based on the current translate setting (1 – Top left; 2 – Top Right, 3 – Bottom right; 4 – Bottom left). The eye pupil is translated in the same way but it also rotates around the internal edges of the eyeball using sine and cosine functions. 
3) Abstract rainbow: 
the abstract rainbow is formed by horizontal and vertical bars of different colours which fluctuate up and down (the vertical ones) or left to right (the horizontal ones).

### GENERATIVE ELEMENT: 
1) Translation:
As mentioned before, part of the structure of the sketch will have its X and Y axis translated whenever 1 - 4 keys are pressed. 
2) Rotation: 
The eye pupil will keep rotating around the internal edges of the eyeball. 
3) Colours: 
The colour of the components of the background and the background itself can change colour whenever the mouse is clicked (The left click changes the colour of the shapes while the right click alters the background colour);
