### TITLE: 
***Digital Detox Synthesizer***

### DESCRIPTION:
For the Sound and Visuals Synthesizer Project, I decided to build a synthesizer that generates different rain sounds using Noise generators available in the Processing Sound library. For the visuals, I decided to recreate different types of rain based on the intensity of the corresponding Noise. The project is called ‘Digital Detox Synthesizer’ and it is aimed at helping reduce the amount of stress whenever working on computers for a prolongated amount of time. The sound of the stream playing in the background and the eventual rain noises generated can relieve the tension in your body and the sound could be played while practising yoga positions. Visuals can also help restore your sense of inner peace.
### ARTWORK STRUCTURE:
1) ***Visual Display***: 
On top of the screen, there is a visual display where the rain will start falling from the clouds based on which toggles have been activated. The background of the display, which represents the sky, will change its colour when sliders at the bottom of the screen are used.   
2) ***Toggles***: 
Below the visual display, there are four toggles which play the corresponding rain noise and display rain effects when activated. The main toggle allows adding rain sounds and effects when turned on. The first toggle generates light sound and rain visual effects via Pink Noise Generator, the second one recreates normal rain sound and effects through White Noise Generator while the last toggle replicates heavy rain sound and visuals using Brown Noise Generator.
3) ***Sliders***: 
Below the toggles section, there are three sliders which control the volume, frequency and panoramic position of the track playing in the background and the eventual noises generated. On top of that, they also control the HSB values of the visual display background colour. Sliders can be controlled manually or using computer keyboard. The first slide controls the volume of the audio and the hue value of the display background, the second one changes the frequency of the audio and the saturation of the visual display colour while the last slider manipulates the panoramic position of the audio played and the brightness of the display background colour.
### APPLICATIONS:
The sketch runs using the Processing Sound Library.
